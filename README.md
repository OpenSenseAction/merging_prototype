# merging_prototype

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/OpenSenseAction/merging_prototype/HEAD)

Preliminary example notebook for showcasing merging of radar, gauge and CML data

Goal for meeting in Prague:
- working example notebook that can be run locally
- (maybe run online via binder)
- use imports from `poligrain` instead of old `ragali` prototype functions
